# Spring_Project
This is a project based on Spring using IntelliJ IDEA. I have created this project on spring enginee. There is a login page in the first step which need to login for user. If the user is not registered then he need to register into registration page. After full fill the form an e-mail will go autometically to his mail address to confirm his mail and token will show to give a password. After giving password he/she will be able to enter into the home pages. From here user can control all the pages.
